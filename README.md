# Personal-Portfolio
A personal portfolio website showcases your skills, projects, and achievements. Key sections include About Me, Projects, Skills, Resume/CV, and Contact Information. Aim for a clean, professional design with a consistent color scheme and typography. Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
